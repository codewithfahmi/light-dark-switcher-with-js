# Light/Dark Switcher

![](illustration.gif)

This is a simple implementation of making a switch that can change the background from light (#E0E0E0) to dark (#212121) using JavaScript.

In the source code, I only implement the add and remove class function and not using localStorage for temporary class storage, but it is possible to use localStorage.
